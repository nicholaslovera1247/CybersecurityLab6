My cracking program crackpassword.py first creates 2 empty dictionaroes to holds first, the cracked passwords, and second the username and cracked password combos. After this, we then use CSV to read into our list of passwords file (common_words.txt has been renamed to listofpasswords.txt, if your file is still common_words.txt please edit this in the code as it won't work if not, I didn't think about this until I was completely done with the assignment I apologize), as we read into this file we encode each password from our list of potential passwords and then assign it as the value and save the cracked password as the key. After this, we iterate through each of the pairs in the hashed_passwords dictionary and then compare it to the encoded password in the passwd file (the pathway to my passwd is different than what yours is in your computer so you will have to change the pathway to where the file is on your computer to use this program, this is because for some reason plugging in just /instance/static/passwd did not work), if the encoded password in the credientals passwd file matches our key's value in our hashed_passwords dictionary, we then print that we found a password with said password, and then assign the said password to the username it is associated with to our userpasscombos dictionary. After all the possible passwords have been found we then create a new file called userpasscombos.txt and then just write in the usernames and their associated passwords. We also print the userpasscombos dictionary to ensure that the text file is indeed written corrected.
